h1. Easy Deployment to Stax' Cloud

Stax is a cloud hosting service for Java applications. While it is possible to run a Play application on Stax without the help of this module, using it will automate some of the tasks you have to do to deploy on Stax.

h2. <a>Usage</a>

Create your application with Stax support:

bc. play new appname --with=stax

When an application has been created with Stax support, war folders generated by Play will be ready for Stax. Just zip it and deploy it:

bc. play war ./yourProject -o project --zip
stax app:deploy -a login/yourProject -u login -p pass project.war

h2. <a>Database</a>

If you included Stax support when you created your application, the file application.conf contains sample parameters for the database settings. Otherwise, here is how you configure it:

bc. db.url=jdbc:stax://yourDataBaseName
db.driver=com.staxnet.jdbc.Driver
db.user=login
db.pass=password
jpa.dialect=org.hibernate.dialect.MySQLDialect
